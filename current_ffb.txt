3.0.7
• ffmpeg 7.0.1 included (essential).
• French translation available.
• New setting at security and performance to disable ffmpeg.exe checksum validation.
• When progress info fails to display, or when using quick file adding, standard ffmpeg output is displayed in progress bar so encoding can be followed up (sequential encoding).
• Verbose logs increased -loglevel for better ffmpeg debugging (could generate big log files).
• Fixed: screen recording audio dialog not available. Updated virtual audio playback driver url for recording audio playback.
• Fixed: very slow custom columns loading from hard disks (multithread info attempted only from SSD/NVMe).
• Minor translations and bugfixes.
